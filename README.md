# irp-wildfire-SCALED-viz
Visualizations from applying SCALED model to wildfire spread prediction

## Repository Structure

This repository contains visualizations organized by dataset and training phase:

- **01-data/**: Visualizations from Dataset 01
  - `training/`: Training phase visualizations
  - `validation/`: Validation phase visualizations
  - `testing/`: Testing phase visualizations

- **02-data/**: Visualizations from Dataset 02
  - `training/`: Training phase visualizations
  - `validation/`: Validation phase visualizations
  - `testing/`: Testing phase visualizations

- **03-data/**: Visualizations from Dataset 03
  - `training/`: Training phase visualizations
  - `validation/`: Validation phase visualizations
  - `testing/`: Testing phase visualizations

## Usage

Each dataset folder contains three subfolders for different phases of the machine learning pipeline:
- **training**: Visualizations generated during model training
- **validation**: Visualizations from model validation
- **testing**: Final visualizations from model testing

Place your visualization files (plots, charts, images, etc.) in the appropriate folder based on the dataset and training phase.
